This is an end-to-end data analysis project using Excel 
The dataset was gotten from a fictional retail organisation and covered a 2 year period; 2018 - 2019
The data was cleaned, analysed and then used to generate relevant business insights, spot trends and used to create an interactive dashboard 
Also, I provided a breakdown of the entire data analysis process, from the start of the project to the end
Finally, I gave the conclusions that i drew from analysing the retail company dataset and also gave recommendations based on the observations I made.
